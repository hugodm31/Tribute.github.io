# Tribute.github.io

Greetings!

This page is, as you can see, a Tribute Page for our little furry animals. If you have an animal that you see as family and not just a pet, lets see them!

Represent them however you want. Doesnt necessarily have to look similar to mine. Think of it as a show and tell.

-IMPORTANT-

  -Add photos and tell us about them. You don't have to provide their name and/or anything about them, if you want to. Just a picture of them being adorable, funny, or minutes before disaster.

  -Let's keep it PG, please.

  -Do whatever you want to this page. You can change the background color, the font and so on. Just DON'T CHANGE ANYTHING THAT INVOLVES ABOUT THE INFO AND PICTURES OF THE ANIMALS.

This is what the page is about, our pet family.
